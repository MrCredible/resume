His mind is always on; ticking with new ideas, developing strategies for internal improvement, and discovering the next move to maintain forward mobility. He has a love for research, a thirst for growth, and a vigorous desire to see his team thrive that can, absolutely, not be matched.

We studied together while working on Masters degrees at UT Dallas, and on the projects we worked on together, he was a stellar team member and leader. Our teams always knew we could count on him to deliver on his promises, meet our team deadlines, and present our information both professionally and in a way that non-technical people could clearly understand the highly technical nature of whatever project we were working on. Justin is someone who I''d love to work with again and I highly recommend him for any position.'

He worked all phases of the software process (requirements through system integration and test) as well as collaboratively with other disciplines (systems, test, electrical and mechanical) to solve system issues.  Although he followed our in-house development processes, he advocated for improvements to our processes based on other work experience and his masters coursework.  I would recommend him for any software or systems position.'
