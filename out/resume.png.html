                    <p>Justin is a self-made powerhouse, with a heart of gold. While we were
                        creating and running Ignite Art Collective, I got to see his drive, passion,
                        and innovative nature in action. His mind is always on; ticking with new
                        ideas, developing strategies for internal improvement, and discovering
                        the next move to maintain forward mobility. He has a love for research,
                        a thirst for growth, and a vigorous desire to see his team thrive that
                        can, absolutely, not be matched. All the while, he stays humble, shows
                        genuine care in the people around him, and holds himself accountable. Having
                        him on our team is what set our brand apart from the rest, and was fundamental
                        in our success.</p>

                     <h3><em>Preston Burkhalter</em></h3>

                    <p>Justin is a rare individual who has the technical skills to build something
                        from the ground up, and the vision to manage a project to completion. We
                        studied together while working on Masters degrees at UT Dallas, and on
                        the projects we worked on together, he was a stellar team member and leader.
                        Our teams always knew we could count on him to deliver on his promises,
                        meet our team deadlines, and present our information both professionally
                        and in a way that non-technical people could clearly understand the highly
                        technical nature of whatever project we were working on. Justin is someone
                        who I&#39;d love to work with again and I highly recommend him for any
                        position.</p>

                    <p>It was a pleasure to work with Justin. He was always conscientious of
                        his work. From quality to timeliness, I never had to worry whether or not
                        Justin was going to deliver. Look forward to hearing about his successes
                        as he grows his career!</p>

                     <h3><em>Michael Lawson</em></h3>

                    <p>Justin worked on developing and maintaining embedded real-time software
                        applications. He worked all phases of the software process (requirements
                        through system integration and test) as well as collaboratively with other
                        disciplines (systems, test, electrical and mechanical) to solve system
                        issues. Although he followed our in-house development processes, he advocated
                        for improvements to our processes based on other work experience and his
                        masters coursework. I would recommend him for any software or systems position.</p>
